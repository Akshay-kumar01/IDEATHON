 **The problem it solves**
 - ***Improving mental health.***
    -  Owing to the present scenario wherein the pandemic situation is affecting the mental health of the people, there is a need for a platform to help in sustaining the mental peace. The platform would be an asset in providing a world or a comfortable space where the users would be able to express their ideas or mental state, anonymously, to ensure complete encapsulation of user data or judgements and promote healing. After a period of time, users can choose to converse on a one-to-one basis.
 - ***No more ignorance to mental health :***
     -  While in India, a major part of the population is ignorant of mental health. There was a total prevalence of anxiety symptoms of **32.60%** during the COVID-19 pandemic. The basic idea is to provide regular sessions by professionals to help people improve their mental health.
 - ***Practice opportunities for beginner therapists:***
    - As the idea of mental health evolves, this platform will provide an opportunity to start practising while they’re in their college, or after graduation, to help people improve their mental health. For increasing the reachability and ensuring the credibility of the sessions, we’ll provide demo sessions by volunteers. Besides, we’ll approach the NGO’s and the government to promote our idea and provide certification to the volunteers participating in:- <br/><br/>
       ***Mental health camps*** <br/>
       ***Seminars***   <br/>
       ***One on one sessions***   <br/>

**Key features:**

         1. Regular mental health sessions will be conducted on a weekly basis.
         2. We’ll try to divert our user’s attention in some activities which would add 
             some value to their life. These activities may include 
         3. Anonymity will allow our platform users to openly share their thoughts 
             without fear of being judged.
